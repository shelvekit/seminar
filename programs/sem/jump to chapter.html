<h1 id="c1">Chapter 1 : What is Java?  </h1>
<p>Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.

It is used for:

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games
Database connection
And much, much more!
Why Use Java?
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
It has a large demand in the current job market
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It is open-source and free
It is secure, fast and powerful
It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
Java Install
Some PCs might have Java already installed.

To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

C:\Users\Your Name>java -version
If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):

java version "22.0.0" 2024-08-21 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 22.9 (build 22.0.0+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 22.9 (build 22.0.0+13-LTS, mixed mode)
If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at oracle.com.

Note: In this tutorial, we will write Java code in a text editor. However, it is possible to write Java in an Integrated Development Environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Netbeans or Eclipse, which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Java files.

Java Quickstart
In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.

Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad).

The file should contain a "Hello World" message, which is written with the following code:

Main.java

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code above.

Save the code in Notepad as "Main.java". Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe), navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and type "javac Main.java":

C:\Users\Your Name>javac Main.java
This will compile your code. If there are no errors in the code, the command prompt will take you to the next line. Now, type "java Main" to run the file:

C:\Users\Your Name>java Main
The output should read:

Hello World
Congratulations! You have written and executed your first Java program.

</p>

<h1 id="c2">Chapter 2 : Java Syntax  </h1>
<p> Java Syntax
In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:

Main.java

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

Example explained
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main.

Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The output should be:

Hello World
The main Method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

public static void main(String[] args)
Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after it. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.

For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:

public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}

Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

Don't worry too much about how System, out and println() works. Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.

You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).</p>

<h1 id="c3">Chapter 3 : Java Variables  </h1>
<p>Java Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:

SyntaxGet your own Java Server
type variableName = value;
Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:

Example
Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John".
Then we use println() to print the name variable:

String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);

To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:

Example
Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:

int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

Example
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);

Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

Example
Change the value of myNum from 15 to 20:

int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);

Final Variables
If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

Example
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable

Other Types
A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types:

Example
int myNum = 5;
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
char myLetter = 'D';
boolean myBool = true;
String myText = "Hello"; 
Java Data Types
As explained in the previous chapter, a variable in Java must be a specified data type:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";     // String

Data types are divided into two groups:

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)
Primitive Data Types
A primitive data type specifies the type of a variable and the kind of values it can hold.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

Data Type	Description
byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean	Stores true or false values
char	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

Numbers
Primitive number types are divided into two groups:

Integer types stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are byte, short, int and long. Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value.

Floating point types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and double.

Even though there are many numeric types in Java, the most used for numbers are int (for whole numbers) and double (for floating point numbers). However, we will describe them all as you continue to read.

Integer Types
Byte
The byte data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127. This can be used instead of int or other integer types to save memory when you are certain that the value will be within -128 and 127:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
byte myNum = 100;
System.out.println(myNum);

Short
The short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767:

Example
short myNum = 5000;
System.out.println(myNum);

Int
The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647. In general, and in our tutorial, the int data type is the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.

Example
int myNum = 100000;
System.out.println(myNum);

Long
The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L":

Example
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);

Floating Point Types
You should use a floating point type whenever you need a number with a decimal, such as 9.99 or 3.14515.

The float and double data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles:

Float Example
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);

Double Example
double myNum = 19.99d;
System.out.println(myNum);

Use float or double?

The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 16 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

Scientific Numbers
A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10:

Example
float f1 = 35e3f;
double d1 = 12E4d;
System.out.println(f1);
System.out.println(d1);

Boolean Types
Very often in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can only take the values true or false:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isFishTasty = false;
System.out.println(isJavaFun);     // Outputs true
System.out.println(isFishTasty);   // Outputs false

Boolean values are mostly used for conditional testing.

You will learn much more about booleans and conditions later in this tutorial.

Characters
The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

ExampleGet your own Java Server
char myGrade = 'B';
System.out.println(myGrade);

Alternatively, if you are familiar with ASCII values, you can use those to display certain characters:

Example
char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
System.out.println(myVar1);
System.out.println(myVar2);
System.out.println(myVar3);

Tip: A list of all ASCII values can be found in our ASCII Table Reference.

Strings
The String data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

Example
String greeting = "Hello World";
System.out.println(greeting);

The String type is so much used and integrated in Java, that some call it "the special ninth type".

A String in Java is actually a non-primitive data type, because it refers to an object. The String object has methods that are used to perform certain operations on strings. Don't worry if you don't understand the term "object" just yet. We will learn more about strings and objects in a later chapter.</p>
